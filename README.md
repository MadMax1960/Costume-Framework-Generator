A shrimple helper for costume framework (p3r) stuff. Lets you drag a folder or costume-mesh.uasset onto it and fill in everything for `config.yaml` and `description.msg`, then it will make both for you. 
I suggest making a shortcut and putting shortcut in sendto folder (win + r then `shell:sendto`). That way you can right click files or folders and send it right to the exe
Currently supports filling out all info supported by costume framework, and even copying from other yamls!
